# INC-1047 — Key Vault Private Endpoint + RBAC Regression

**Severity:** SEV-2  
**Service:** Internal Platform Secrets Layer  
**Environment:** Production  
**Primary Region:** West Europe  
**Secondary Region:** North Europe  

## Summary

After deploying a Key Vault private endpoint pattern across two regions, services running in the secondary region intermittently fail secret retrieval. A parallel security review flags privilege scope concerns for the platform identity, and finance reports show incomplete tag coverage for cost allocation.

## Observed symptoms

- Secret reads fail from secondary-region workloads due to name resolution / connectivity instability to the Key Vault private endpoint.
- Security review flags least-privilege concerns for role definitions/assignments.
- Cost allocation reports are missing required dimensions (Owner, CostCenter) for a subset of resources.

## Constraints

- Keep the design private-by-default (no public Key Vault access).
- Preserve modularity and multi-region intent.
- Avoid adding cloud API dependencies for validation (offline checks only).

## Acceptance criteria

- Secondary region can reliably resolve Key Vault private endpoint DNS and reach the endpoint across intended network paths.
- RBAC is aligned with least-privilege expectations for the platform identity and avoids overly broad scopes.
- Required tags are consistently applied.
- CI green on `fmt`, `validate`, and guardrails.
